This is an adder for `svelte-add`; you should [read its `README`](https://github.com/svelte-add/svelte-add#readme) before continuing here.

## ➕ Adding SCSS

This adder's codename is `scss`, and can be used like so:

```sh
npx svelte-add@latest scss
```

### 🏞 Supported environments

This adder supports SvelteKit and Vite-powered Svelte apps (all the environments `svelte-add` currently supports).

### ⚙️ Options

This adder doesn't take any options of its own.

## 🛠 Using SCSS

After the adder runs,

- You can write SCSS syntax in the `style lang="scss"` blocks in Svelte files.

- You can write SCSS syntax in the `src/app.scss` file.

  This is your global stylesheet because it will be active on every page of your site.
